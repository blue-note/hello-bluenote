# Hello, Bluenote!

I'm blue-note. I'm reaching out because I would really love to have the username "bluenote" (that pesky hyphen is really getting on my nerves.) I saw that there doesn't seem to be much (public) activity on your account, and was wondering if you might be willing to part with your username by renaming or deleting your account? Totally fine if not, just thought I'd ask. You can get in touch with me via email at janitachalam@gmail.com.

Thanks!
